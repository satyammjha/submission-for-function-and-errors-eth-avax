**Rectangle Area Calculator**

**Overview**
This Solidity smart contract allows for the calculation of the area of a rectangle based on its length and width inputs. It includes ownership control to restrict access to the area calculation function.

**Features**

- **Ownership Control**: Only the contract owner can calculate the area of the rectangle.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures both length and width are positive integers before calculating the area.
- **Error Handling**: Checks for possible overflow conditions during area calculation.

**Contract Details**

- **Owner**: The contract owner is set at deployment (`msg.sender`).
- **Functionality**: Provides a `calculateArea` function that takes length and width as parameters and returns the calculated area.
- **Safety Checks**: Uses `require` for ownership validation and `assert` to verify positive inputs and prevent overflow.

**Usage**

1. **Deployment**: Deploy the contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
2. **Ownership**: Only the address that deployed the contract (`msg.sender`) has access to the `calculateArea` function.
3. **Function Call**: Call the `calculateArea` function with valid positive integers for length and width to get the area of the rectangle.
